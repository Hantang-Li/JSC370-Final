My R markdown failed to jnit in the last minute, so I attached the summary part as txt file.

In summary, clearly, the YouTube video is still popular nowadays because, according to the box plot and t-test, the average and median of the number of views have increased from 2017 to 2022. And using advanced regression, we found that people tend to watch shorter videos as shorter videos get more views, and it is better not to make your video length 400 seconds, as it might make your video obtain fewer views. By using text mining, People in 2022 tend to watch more game-related videos with the title Minecraft and Fortnite, while people back in 2017 watch more entertainment videos. And in general, Entertainment is the most popular category in both years. In the last step, we analyzed the relationship between publish time and the number of views and found that videos published at 4, 5 and 8 in the morning tend to have higher views. For future work, people can try to formulate a method of using video titles and descriptions to fit a model to predict video views. That would be interesting.
